# Demo Jupyter Notebook for OpenMR

## This repository
This repository holds the demo notebook for the talk "Data visualization with MNE-Python" at the virtual conference OpenMR, March 2021.

The notebook demonstrates a data analysis pipeline for MEG data, from raw data to source reconstruction, with a focus on interactive plotting. 
Since the notebook is intended for a live demo, the explanations in the notebook are sparse, but a more explanatory version of this notebook can be found in [this MNE-Python tutorial](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/source-modeling/plot_beamformer_lcmv.html#sphx-glr-auto-tutorials-source-modeling-plot-beamformer-lcmv-py).
The demo uses a public data set, that is readily availble through MNE-Python.
